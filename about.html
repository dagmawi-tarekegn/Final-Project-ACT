                <h3>Dagmawi Tarekegn</h3>
                <p>As a computer science student and self-taught web developer, I know firsthand how challenging it can
                    be to learn coding on your own. That's why I created CodeMentor - to provide the guidance and
                    resources I wish I had when I started.</p>
                <p>My goal is to help aspiring developers build the skills they need to succeed in the tech industry.
